# Analysis-of-Google-Play-Store-Review
We use sentiment analysis to classify feedback into positives and negatives, and then identify main topics of reviews, especially negative ones, to better understand customers’ complaints. By recognizing the most frequently mentioned issues, the app developers are able to prioritize the problems to be solved by urgency and importance, dealing with app issues more effectively to meet customers’ needs.  

The dataset contains the reviews of 11 UK mobile bank apps which are Monzo, Revolut, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander, TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland, Metrobank, and Halifax. For each app, we extracted 200 reviews for the score of 1, 2, 4, and 5, and 150 reviews for the score of 3.
